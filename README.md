## Overview

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

‚ö° This challenge was to build a responsive FAQ card, using HTML and CSS, with accordion interactivity applied to make the questions drop down on click, using JS.

üöÄ I built this while following [@TheCoderCoder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNf0liwUzMN6_pixbQlMhQ)'s free live code video on YouTube. Check it out here: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FboXxLxg8eo), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr94O6Y5NEA). I noticed some differences afterwards between what was completed in the video and the design images, so I made some modifications, as well as fixed some accessibility issues. This gave me great practice!

### Challenge Requirements

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
